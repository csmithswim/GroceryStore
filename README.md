This package contains OOPS and Java work.

Abstract classes and methods - When you declare a class but don't instantiate it,you can only extend it.

An abstract method just has the declaration, there is no body to the method. 

A final class means we cannot extend it. They are rarely used. Strings cannot be final because they are immutable.

A final method cannot be overridden.

Try to implement just one or two levels of inheritance. 

Multiple inheritance is not supported in Java and is discouraged.

Interfaces are used to build loosely-coupled, extensible, testable applications.

Interface - What should be done. I.e. data compression, encryption, sorting and searching.

Classes - How it should be done. 

Dependency Injection - our classes should not instantiate their dependencies.

With dependency injection classes should not create and use objects, only one of the two, this is called the separation of concerns.

Dependency injection can be done with constructor inject, setter injection or method injection.
